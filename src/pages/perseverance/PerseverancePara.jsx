        At the heart of Perseverance's scientific prowess is its instrument
        suite, which includes advanced tools like the SuperCam and the PIXL
        (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry). These instruments aid
        in studying Martian rocks and soil, providing valuable insights into the
        planet's geology and potential signs of past life. Perseverance also
        carries the Ingenuity helicopter, demonstrating the first powered flight
        on another planet, opening new possibilities for aerial exploration.
